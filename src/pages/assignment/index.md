Originally presented from the male view <br/>
Cultural resistance and expression fuel hip hop <br/>
With the world trying to pursue <br/>
Hip hop produces the space for expressiveness nonstop <br/>
Creating their own cultural resistance to resist domination and detractors <br/>
Creating a space that includes a litany of factors <br/>
**Meryem Saci follows this path from Algeria to Montreal** <br/>
**The Algerian expressiveness running through her soul** <br/>
**On her way, third eye woke steady, 10 feet tall**<br/>
**Music and dance, medicines that keep her whole** <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Isoke explores the spaces hip hop women of color cultivate** <br/>
**to culturally resist inequality through music as their motif**<br/>
**Advocating for youth solidarity at a high rate**<br/>
**Their voices as big a massif**<br/>
**Resistance, critique, and discontent** <br/>
**From M.I.A to Reem Osman to Abeer Al Zinati**<br/>
**These are the foundations of hip hop they represent**<br/>
**Their Hip Hop is addressing gender inequality**<br/>
**For the ears that stretch West to middle east**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
International hip hop shines from women with mystique<br/>
Who create diverse cultural production<br/>
**And refuse to be categorized as the refugee chic** <br/>
**Racialized depictions never deter despite obstruction**<br/>
**M.I.A performs this task**<br/>
**Watch out for her, like Meryem, she is on her way**<br/>
**Toward defining herself with music tracks**<br/>
**Resisting layers of domination that led astray**<br/>
Creating her own digital ruckus and standard<br/>
M.I.A, a cultural producer<br/>
Inspiring women to create their own image not tampered<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On her way, Meryem reps her culture<br/>
Her music is an escape from all ills in society<br/>
**The symbolic and material show vividly in color**<br/>
**The artistic expressions come in all varieties**<br/>
**Even more apparent is her womanist prose**<br/>
**Generations before her helped plant the creative seeds**<br/>
**Grasping the seeds, her creativity grows**<br/>
**A granddaughter using gifts passed down to her**<br/>
**leveraging those gifts for artistic expression** <br/>
**raps, rhymes, and killer verse**<br/>
**She is ignited by hip hop to construct at her own digression**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hip hop can be complex<br/>
Producing a range of emotions and imagery<br/>
Women using hip hop for protest<br/>
Listeners receive the message the in many ways<br/>
Melodies, raps, catchy hooks all are part of the equation<br/>
All over the world we see innovation<br/>
Women in hip hop becoming their own nation<br/>
